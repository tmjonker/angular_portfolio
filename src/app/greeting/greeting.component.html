                I've been working exhaustively toward getting myself ready to
                enter the workforce as a software developer by taking classes on
                web design, java development, spring boot, android development,
                and SQL/database management. I have been working on several
                personal projects that showcase my skills in these areas and you
                can view the source code for these projects by visiting my
                github.
